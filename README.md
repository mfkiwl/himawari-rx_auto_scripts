**``himawari-rx__auto.bat``** is the main script for start ``TSDuck`` to record a dump file, then rename the dump file and start ``himawari-rx__decode.bat`` automatic when ``TSDuck`` is terminated, and start ``TSDuck`` again at the same time to record next round.

**``himawari-rx__decode.bat``** is the script for start ``himawari-rx`` to receive files, and make pictures automatic. It will start automatic by the ``himawari-rx__auto.bat`` script.
